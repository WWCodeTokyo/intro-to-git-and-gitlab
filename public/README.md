# Intro to Git and GitLab


## Course description

Git is a popular version control system that allows you to easily track code changes and collaborate on projects with any number of people. In this workshop, we will go over the basics of version control, Git, and how to use GitLab to collaborate with other developers.

### Prerequisites:

We won't be working on actual code in this class so there is no need for you to know any particular programming language. We will be using the command line to change directories, list directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class, so it is important that you feel comfortable with that. You should bring your own computer to class as we will be installing software and you will need administrator privelages.


### What you'll need (tech):

 - A laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
 - A code editor. We recommend Visual Studio Code (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).


### What we'll cover:

In this workshop we'll cover:

 - the basic concepts of git version control
 - installing git
 - git commands to track changes to a small project
 - set up a free gitlab account
 - create an SSH Key
 - the basics of collaborating on projects with other developers
