    Review each of these commands. Remind the class that these are git commands, different from bash commands. They must put 'git' before each one of the commands, and they will only work in a Git repository.
    <br><br>
    ** Git Add - This adds the files to the repo to be tracked AND stages it. Staging is different than adding. Staging tells git to track the current state of the file.
    <br><br>
      ** Git Commit  - A commit saves the changes made to the file, not the file itself. Each commit has a 'hash' so we can track which changes were committed when and by whom.
      <br><br>
    ** What is a hash? - Git uses SHA-1 hashes. An SHA-1 is an algorithm that takes some data as input and generates a unique 40 character string from it. That means each commit is 100% unique.
