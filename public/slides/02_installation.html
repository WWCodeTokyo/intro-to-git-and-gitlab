  <h3>Check your computer for Git</h3>
  <pre class="large">
    <code data-trim data-noescape>
      $ git --version
    </code>

  <p>** No need to type in the $, this just indicates it is a shell command.</p>

    *INSTRUCTOR: Walk participants through commands on screen **explain that they do not have to type in the $, this just indicates it is a shell command.
    <br><br>
    It is time to get started. Let's check and see if you have Git. Run appropriate command to check. The command is the same for Mac or Windows.
    <br><br>
    If your terminal responds with a message like this: "git version 2.0.1", you have an official version installed.
    <br><br>
    If you're prompted to install Xcode, or the command line developer tools, you either do not have git installed, or don't have it in your $PATH variable.
    <br><br>
    For Mac users: If you get a message like "git version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)", you have Git installed from Apple (through Xcode or the command line developer tools), and can most likely benefit from installing the latest build directly from the official Git website.
