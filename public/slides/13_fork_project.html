    Next, we are going to navigate to the Women Who Code Group.
    <br><br>
    GitLab Groups allow you to assemble related projects and grant members access to several projects at once.
    <br><br>
    Groups can also be nested into subgroups.
    <br><br>
    To find our group, click on 'Groups' in the header. Next, select the 'Explore public groups' tab. In the search bar, enter 'Women Who Code.'
    <br><br>
    You should see our group in the results list. Click on it.

    *INSTRUCTOR: If time allows, you may want to take this opportunity to point out key features of the interface.

    In GitLab, you can create projects for hosting your codebase, use it as an issue tracker, collaborate on code, and continuously build, test, and deploy your app with built-in GitLab CI/CD.
    <br><br>
    Your projects can be available publicly, internally, or privately, at your choice. GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you create.
    <br><br>
    Look at the WWC Group page. You should see a list of projects associated with this group.
    <br><br>
    Find and choose the 'Intro to Git and GitLab group.'

    Next, we are going to fork the 'Intro to Git and GitLab' project.
    <br><br>
    A fork is a copy of an original repository. We will make a copy of the original project and place it in a new namespace. Doing so allows us to experiment and apply changes without affecting the original project.
    <br><br>
    It takes just a few steps to fork a project in GitLab.
    <br><br>
    Start by clicking the 'fork' button at the top of the project page.

    Once you do that, you'll be presented with a screen where you can choose the namespace under which you'd like to place the fork. Only namespaces (groups and your own namespace) where you have write access to, will be shown. Click on the namespace to create your fork there.

  <h3>Success!</h3>

    You should now see the forked project under your username. *INSTRUCTOR: It may be helpful to point out the breadcrumbs that now show the project under their username.
    <br><br>
    Forking a project has two purposes. It allows you to suggest changes to the existing project. In this case, you would make changes to your local copy and create a merge request to have them pushed 'upstream' to the original. A forked project can also be used as a starting point for your own. In many instances, people will 'fork' a boilerplate project to give them a jump-start on their own.
    <br><br>
    The latter is what we are doing today. We do not want to push changes back to the original repo. Instead, we want to play around with this on our own.
    <br><br>
    So, before we start, let's remove the forked relationship.
