    Let's make our first merge request. What is a merge request? Exactly what it sounds like,  a request to merge one branch into another.
    <br><br>
    Go back to your project homepage in GitLab. At the top of the screen, you should see a message about your recent changes to the branch. This message includes a button to create a merge request. Go ahead and press it!

    You have several options here. You can change the title and add a description. These can help others quickly understand what this merge request is all about.
    <br><br>
    Further down, you can assign a particular person to review your merge request. Most teams have a process for who reviews and merges these requests.
    <br><br>
    You can assign a milestone. Milestones allow you to organize issues and merge requests into a cohesive group, with an optional start date and an optional due date.
    <br><br>
    Labels can be added to tag the merge request. Labels provide an easy way to categorize the issues or merge requests based on descriptive titles like bug, documentation or any other text. They can have different colors, a description, and are visible throughout the issue tracker or inside each issue individually.
    <br><br>
    At the very bottom of the page, you will see the 'Source Branch' and the 'Target Branch.' The 'Source Branch' is the branch you are on., It is the 'source' of the changes. The 'Target Branch' is the branch into which the changes will be merged. It is the 'target' for the changes.

    Once submitted, you will be redirected to the merge request. Here you can see that you have the option to merge the branch. We can also add labels, assign someone, or comment on the mere request. Before we approve this merge request, let's take a look at the changes we made.

    Today we will just go ahead and merge the changes to understand the flow.

    *INSTRUCTOR: Instruct participants to click the 'Merge' button in the MR widget. You may want to explain the 'remove source' and 'squash commit' options. For simplicity, they should not choose those options.
