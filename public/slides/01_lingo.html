		Branches allow each developer to "branch" off of master to work independently. Later on, they will be able to merge their changes back into the master branch or merge changes made to master into their branch.

		So here you can see the master version, then someone can make a branch out of the master, make some changes and merge the changes back into the master version.

		And here's a fork, that's a complete copy of the repo that will be totally independent and can go in a different direction from this point on. A fork is like a "spin-off" of the main story.

		Common question: What is the difference between a branch and a fork? Branching and forking are two ways of diverging from the master version. A branch, like a branch of a tree, remains part of the original repo. The master and the branch know and rely on each other.
		A fork is independent from the original repo. If the original repo is deleted, the fork remains. If you fork a repo, you copy everything, that repo and all of its branches as well.
