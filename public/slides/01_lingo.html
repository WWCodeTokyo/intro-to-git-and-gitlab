		Branches allow each developer to "branch" off of master to work independently. Later on, they will be able to merge their changes back into the master branch or merge changes made to master into their branch.

		Common question: What is the difference between a branch and a fork? Branching and forking are two ways of diverging from the main code. A branch, like a branch of a tree, remains part of the original repo. The master and the branch know and rely on each other.
		A fork is independent from the original repo. If the original repo is deleted, the fork remains. If you fork a repo, you get that repo and all of its branches.
