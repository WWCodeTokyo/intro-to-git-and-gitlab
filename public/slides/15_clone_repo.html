    Now that we have our copy of the project, we can work on it locally. To work on a git project locally (from your computer), you will need to clone it.
    <br><br>
    To clone the project, you can copy a link to the Git repository through an SSH or an HTTPS protocol. SSH is easier to use after it's been set up, luckily we have already done that!
    <br><br>
    While you are at the Project tab, select HTTPS or SSH from the drop-down menu and copy the link using the 'Copy to clipboard' button (you'll have to paste it on your shell in the next step).

    In your terminal, get yourself into the directory you want to clone the repo. The directory you choose is up to you; you can clone it into a unique folder you create, your desktop, etc. Just make sure you know where you are cloning it and will be able to find it quickly again.
    <br><br>
    Once you have navigated to the place you want to clone the file, clone it locally using the git clone command. This will immediately create a clone of the project on your computer.
    <br><br>
    Once complete, run the list command (ls) to make sure you see the clone.
    <br><br>
    Then, move inside your cloned repo by using the change directories (cd) command.
