    Once logged in, you can do a number of things.
    <br><br>
    You can create a project. A project is where you house your files (the repo), plan your work (using GitLab issues), and publish documents (GitLab wiki).
    <br><br>
    You can have a project without any code and use issues to track and plan work or the wiki to publish documents.
    <br><br>
    You can have a repo with your codebase and never use issues or the wiki.
    <br><br>
    It is all up to you!
    <br><br>
    You can create a group. Groups are the best way to manage multiple projects and members.
    <br><br>
    You can also explore public projects or learn more about GitLab using our documentation.
