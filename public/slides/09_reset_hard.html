    What happens if you committed the file already? Remember, once a file is committed, it is logged in the index.
    <br><br>
    Let's give it a try. Open your text file again and add some text.
    <br><br>
    Next, add it using 'git add.'
    <br><br>
    Next, commit it using 'git commit.'
    <br><br>
    Whoops! We didn't want to add that. How do we fix it?

      Run the command, 'git log.' This command will output the hash# belonging to the latest commits. Remember the hash? It is the unique 40 character # Git gives to each commit. It's about to come in very handy!
      <br><br>
      Copy the commit Hash for the commit BEFORE the bad one we just made, then type in  ':q' to exit the log.
      <br><br>
      Type in the command 'git reset' followed by the hash number you just copied. You should immediately see the output on the command line stating: 'On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean.'
      <br><br>
      What just happened? Well, we had already committed the change which meant that we could not simply checkout the file to undo the change.
      We had to go a step further and tell Git to reset the last commit. This command rewinds your repository’s history all the way back to the specified hash.
      git reset preserves the working directory, the commits are gone, but the contents are still on disk.
      Revert is the safest option, but sometimes, you’ll want to “undo” the commits and the changes in one move—that’s what --hard does.
