						Branches allow each developer to "branch" off of master to work independently. Later on, they will be able to merge their changes back into the master branch or merge changes made to master into their branch.

						Common question: What is the difference between a branch and a fork? Branching and forking are two ways of diverging from the main code. A branch, like a branch of a tree, remains part of the original repo. The master and the branch know and rely on each other. 
						A fork is independent from the original repo. If the original repo is deleted, the fork remains. If you fork a repo, you get that repo and all of its branches.

						*INSTRUCTOR: Walk participants through commands on screen **explain that they do not have to type in the $, this just indicates it is a shell command.
						<br><br>
						It is time to get started. Let's check and see if you have Git. Run appropriate command to check. The command is the same for Mac or Windows.
						<br><br>
						If your terminal responds with a message like this: "git version 2.0.1", you have an official version installed.
						<br><br>
						If you're prompted to install Xcode, or the command line developer tools, you either do not have git installed, or don't have it in your $PATH variable.
						<br><br>
						For Mac users: If you get a message like "git version 1.9.3 (Apple Git-50)", you have Git installed from Apple (through Xcode or the command line developer tools), and can most likely benefit from installing the latest build directly from the official Git website.

						Initialize your Git repository by running 'git init.' This command creates an empty Git repository. You should see a notice on the command line telling you. "Initialized empty Git repository in /Usesr/..." 
						<br><br>
						*INSTRUCTOR: A lot is going on behind the scenes here that may be overwhelming for those just learning. A .git directory with the necessary subdirectories and an initial HEAD file is created. In short, this is everything needed to create a master branch and start tracking changes.

						Now, let's tell Git to track this new file. Do this by typing in the 'git add' command followed by the name of the file you just created. This command tells Git to add it to the tracked files.

						Review each of these commands. Remind the class that these are git commands, different from bash commands. They must put 'git' before each one of the commands, and they will only work in a Git repository.
						<br><br>
						** Git Add - This adds the files to the repo to be tracked AND stages it. Staging is different than adding. Staging tells git to track the current state of the file. 
						<br><br>
 						** Git Commit  - A commit saves the changes made to the file, not the file itself. Each commit has a 'hash' so we can track which changes were committed when and by whom. 
						 <br><br>
						** What is a hash? - Git uses SHA-1 hashes. An SHA-1 is an algorithm that takes some data as input and generates a unique 40 character string from it. That means each commit is 100% unique.

							</code>

					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Nobody's perfect. Let's walk through how to handle mistakes. 
						<br><br>
						Earlier, we created a text file and committed it to be tracked by git. Open that file using notepad/text-edit (right click=> Open with).
						<br><br>
						Now, type something into the file and save it (ctrl+S).
						<br><br>
						Whoops! We made a mistake. We didn't mean to change that file. What can we do?!
						<br><br>
						In the terminal, type the command 'git checkout my-file.txt.' This command will update the files in your root working directory to match the version in the index.
						<br><br>
						Go ahead and check it. Close the text file (if still open) and then reopen it. The text you typed in should be gone. But Why?
						<br><br>
						You made changes to the file but never committed them to the index. Until you commit them, they only exist locally. It is important to remember this as you work with Git. Remember to commit your changes frequently.

						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								git reset HEAD my-file.txt
							</code>
						</pre>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						What happens if you added the file already? Remember, once a file is added, it is 'staged' in the index. That means Git is aware there has been a change added but not committed.
						<br><br>
						Let's give it a try. Open your text file again and add some text.
						<br><br>
						Next, add it to Git using 'git add.'
						<br><br>
						Whoops! We didn't want to add that. How do we fix it?
						<br><br>
						Run the next command, 'git reset HEAD my-file.txt.'
						<br><br>
						You should see a notification in the terminal which says: Unstaged changes after reset: my-file.txt
						<br><br>
						This command tells Git to unstage the file and set the index of the file back to the last HEAD. HEAD is the name given to the commit from which the working tree's current state was initialized. Your changes still exist in the file but they are no longer staged in the index. Running git status will show the unstaged changes. *INSTRUCTOR: This may take further exposition as HEAD can be a confusing idea for beginners)

						What happens if you committed the file already? Remember, once a file is committed, it is logged in the index.
						<br><br>
						Let's give it a try. Open your text file again and add some text.
						<br><br>
						Next, add it using 'git add.'
						<br><br>
						Next, commit it using 'git commit.'
						<br><br>
						Whoops! We didn't want to add that. How do we fix it?
						<br><br>
						Run the command, 'git log.' This command will output the hash# belonging to the latest commits. Remember the hash? It is the unique 40 character # Git gives to each commit. It's about to come in very handy!
						<br><br>
						Copy the commit Hash for the commit BEFORE the bad one we just made, then type in  ':q' to exit the log.
						<br><br>
						Type in the command 'git reset' followed by the hash number you just copied. You should immediately see the output on the command line stating: 'On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean.'
						<br><br>
						What just happened? Well, we had already committed the change which meant that we could not simply checkout the file to undo the change. We had to go a step further and tell Git to reset the last commit. This command rewinds your repository’s history all the way back to the specified hash. git reset preserves the working directory, the commits are gone, but the contents are still on disk. Revert is the safest option, but sometimes, you’ll want to “undo” the commits and the changes in one move—that’s what --hard does.

						Before we do anything, we need to set up your SSH Key. What is an SSH Key?
						<br><br>
						To push your changes to a GitLab server, you need a secure communication channel for sharing information. The SSH protocol provides this security and allows you to authenticate to the GitLab remote server without supplying your username or password each time.

						Step by step documentation here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#doc-nav

						You should now see the forked project under your username. *INSTRUCTOR: It may be helpful to point out the breadcrumbs that now show the project under their username.
						<br><br>
						Forking a project has two purposes. It allows you to suggest changes to the existing project. In this case, you would make changes to your local copy and create a merge request to have them pushed 'upstream' to the original. A forked project can also be used as a starting point for your own. In many instances, people will 'fork' a boilerplate project to give them a jump-start on their own.
						<br><br>
						The latter is what we are doing today. We do not want to push changes back to the original repo. Instead, we want to play around with this on our own.

						Further down, you can assign a particular person to review your merge request. Most teams have a process for who reviews and merges these requests.

						At the very bottom of the page, you will see the 'Source Branch' and the 'Target Branch.' The 'Source Branch' is the branch you are on., It is the 'source' of the changes. The 'Target Branch' is the branch into which the changes will be merged. It is the 'target' for the changes.
