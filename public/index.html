						Next, use the 'Change Directory' command to move inside the directory you just made.
						You must be inside a folder in order to initialize Git.
						<br><br>
						Initialize your Git repository by running 'git init'. This command creates an empty Git repository. You should see a notice in the command line telling you. "Initialized empty Git repository in /Usesr/..." 
						<br><br>
						(** There is a lot going on behind the scenes here that may be overwhelming for those just learning. A .git directory with the necessary subdirectories and an initial HEAD file is created. In short, this is everything needed to create a master branch and start tracking changes).

						<br><br>
						Now, let's tell Git to track this new file. Do this by typing in the 'git add' command followed by the name of the file you just created. This tells Git to add it to the files to be tracked.
						<br><br>
						Tell the class to run the 'git status' command and tell you what they see.(** tey should see, Initial commit / Changes to be comitted:...)

						Review each of these commands. Remind the class that these are git commands, different from bash commands. They must put 'git' before each one for the commands to work, and they will only work in a Git repository.
						<br><br>
						** Git Add - This adds the files to the repo to be tracked AND stages it. Staging is different than adding. Staging tells git to track the current state of the file. 
						<br><br>
						** Git Commit  - A commits saves the changes made to the file, not the file itself. Each commit has a 'hash' so we can track which changes were committed when and by whom. 
						<br><br>
						** What is a hash? - Git uses SHA-1 hashes. An SHA-1 is an algorithm that takes some data as input and generates a unique 40 character string from it. That means each commit is 100% unique.

					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Nobody's perfect. Let's walk through how to handle mistakes. 
						<br><br>
						Earlier, we created a text file and conmitted it to be tracked by git. Open that file using notepad/text-edit (right click=> Open with).
						<br><br>
						Now, type something into the file and save it (ctrl+S).
						<br><br>
						Whoops! We made a mistake. We didn't mean to change that file. What can we do?!
						<br><br>
						In terminal, type the command 'git checkout myfile.txt'. This will update the files in your root working directory to match the version in the index.
						<br><br>
						Go ahead and check it. Close the text file (if still open) and then reopen it. The text you typed in should be gone. But Why?
						<br><br>
						You made changes to the file but never committed them to the index. Until you commit them, they only exist locally. This is an important thing to remember as you work with git. Remember to commit your changes frequently.

				<!-- Slide 20 -->
				<section>
					<h5>Let's make <span class="u-orange">a staged mistake</span> .</h5>
					<div class="fragment fade-left">
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								git add myfile.txt
							</code>
						</pre>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment fade-left">
						<h5>Let's <span class="u-orange">fix it</span> !</h5>
						<pre>
							<code data-trim data-noescape>
								git reset HEAD myfile.txt
							</code>
						</pre>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						What happens if you added the file already? Remember, once a file is added, it is 'staged' in the index. That means Git is aware there has been a change added but not commited.
						<br><br>
						Let's give it a try. Open your text file again and add some text.
						<br><br>
						Next, add it to Git using 'git add'
						<br><br>
						Whoops! We didn't want to add that. How do we fix it?
						<br><br>
						Run the next command, 'git reset HEAD myfile.txt'
						<br><br>
						Go ahead and check it. Close the text file (if still open) and then reopen it. The text you typed in should be gone. But Why?
						<br><br>
						This command tells Git to throw away any uncommitted changes and set the file back to the last HEAD. HEAD is simply the name given to the commit from which the working tree's current state was initialized. (** This may take further exposition as HEAD can be a confusing idea for beginners)

						Next, add it using 'git add'
						<br><br>
						Next, commit it using 'git commit'
						<br><br>
						Whoops! We didn't want to add that. How do we fix it?
						<br><br>
						Run the command, 'git log'. This will output the hash# belonging to the latest commit. Remember the hash? It is the unique 40 character # Git gives to each commit. It's about to come in very handy!
						<br><br>
						Copy the commit Hash, then type in :q to exit the log.
						<br><br>
						Type in the command 'git revert' followed by the hash number you just copied. You should immediately see an output in the command line stating: 'On branch master
						nothing to commit, working tree clean'
						<br><br>
						What just happened? Well, we had already committed the change which meant that we could not simply reset. We had to go a step further and tell Git to revert the last commit. This essentially removes the changes from that commit and set's it back to the HEAD state before that commit was made.

						The final step is to add your public SSH key to GitLab.
						<br><br>
						Navigate to the 'SSH Keys' tab in your 'Profile Settings'. Paste your key in the 'Key' section and give it a relevant 'Title'. Use an identifiable title like 'Work Laptop - Windows 7' or 'Home MacBook Pro 15'.
						<br><br>
						If you manually copied your public SSH key make sure you copied the entire key starting with ssh-rsa and ending with your email.
